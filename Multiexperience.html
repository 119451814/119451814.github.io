		<h1> What is Multiexperience ? </h1>
		<p>Multiexperience is a concept pioneered by Gartner late in 2019.
		The concept is being championed as one of the biggest developments for 2020.
		In fact, Gartner states that “more than 25% of the mobile apps, progressive web apps
		and conversational apps at large enterprises will be built and/or run through a multiexperience development platform” by 2023.
        In short, multiexperience is about adapting to the increasing market of different devices and their respective experiences.
		Applications now need to run on different platforms and adapt easily, all while providing a consistent experience from a business perspective.</p>
		<h1> Why is it Relevant?</h1>
		<p>For one, it’s because a few companies are already doing it and, for another,
		it’s because the average individual currently owns 3.2 different devices. In other words, 
		it’s becoming the increasingly expected norm.</p>
