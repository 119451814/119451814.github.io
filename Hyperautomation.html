		<h1> What is Hyperautomation? </h1>
		<p>Hyperautomation isn’t simply replicating how tasks are completed with robotic process automation (RPA).
		That was merely the first step in the evolution of this type of technology. A key attribute of hyperautomation
		is its ability to loop humans into the process. 
        Businesses can then access collaborative intelligence,
		as Accenture calls it. With technology and humans working not just side by side but together,
		employees can begin to train automation tools and, through machine learning, get to a state of AI-enabled decision-making. 
		With hyperautomation, companies can begin to reimagine work typically done by employees with technology. </p>
		<h1> It Is the Future! </h1>
		<p> First, hyperautomation can alleviate the stress on businesses in the wake of the talent shortage.
		It’s not just a headline, it’s a reality. The rapidly aging workforce means it will only intensify.
		Employees are expected to do more with less, and it’s significantly impacting their experience at work.
		Current automation tools aim to alleviate employees from mundane, time-consuming tasks that don’t positively contribute 
		to their experience or make the best use of their time. </p>
