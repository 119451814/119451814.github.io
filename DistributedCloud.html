		<h1> What is Distributed Cloud ? </h1>
		<p> Distributed Cloud Computing generalizes the cloud computing model to position,
		process, and serve data and applications from geographically distributed sites to meet requirements for performance, 
		redundancy and regulations. </p>
		<h1>Traditional Cloud Computing vs. Distributed Cloud </h1>
		<p> The traditional cloud computing model offers on-demand,
		metered access to computing resources—storage, servers, databases, and applications—to users who do not want to build, 
		buy, or run their own IT infrastructure. Public cloud service providers maintain and run large server farms whose
		resources are shared between users, with virtualization techniques that provide isolation and security of individual user data.
		Site redundancy across regions provides for recovery from outages and disasters, with all the monitoring and management
		aspects of keeping the cloud up and running transparent to cloud users.
        While distributed computing spreads computation workload across multiple, interconnected servers, 
		distributed cloud computing generalizes this to the cloud infrastructure itself. 
		A distributed cloud is an execution environment where application components are placed at appropriate geographically-dispersed
		locations chosen to meet the requirements of the application. </p>
